So those hex clocks are everywhere (http://thecolourclock.co.uk/), and I wanted one for my mac.  Yeah, they have a download, but I wanted to play with objective-c and xcode.  No clue what I'm doing. :)  This is probably the world's most memory-intensive screen saver, sloppy coding, etc., etc.  Looks nice, though.
